# The program establishes a connection on a defined port and hostname and uses the getopt module included in python to gather information from the user, to use that information to carry out the transfering of the desired file.
# Some problems I ran into were the little knowledge of pyhto in order to carry out this project and while I am not an expert on it, I do believe I have learned from this assignment
# Some pre-existing modules I used for this project were sys, getopt and socket to better carry out the  purpose of the assignment
